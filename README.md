# key-typer
This is a low budget key that you can use to type strong passwords on programs like [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) (or whatever you want it), so you don't need to memorize all your huge password! 

## Arduino Uno
**Important: This is a totally home made solution to speed up typing huge chars' sequence. So, keep with you and avoid sharing with others.**

## Example

## Requirements
- Arduino Uno (*If you have an Arduino Leonardo, Arduino Micro Pro or any other Arduino compatible devices that uses `ATmega32U4`, this code doesn't fits to you*).
- Update your Arduino Uno's firmware to act like a HID (Human Interface Device). The following videos will help you to configure it.

## Step by step
Please, follow these videos:

If you are having a hard time to work with Flip on Windows 10, you can download from [here](http://77.161.176.191/domoticx/software/atmel_flip/JRE%20-%20Flip%20Installer%20-%203.4.7.112.exe.7z) or try it from the official [website](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/flip).

## Arduino Pro Micro
If you have this board, you don't need to follow the previous steps, you just need to use the [`my-key.ino`](my-key.ino) file and you should be good. You can take a look at the following section as an example, but my soldering skills are pretty bad!
