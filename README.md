# key-typer
This is a low budget key that you can use to type strong passwords on programs like [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) (or whatever you want it), so you don't need to memorize all your huge password! 

**Important: This is a totally home made solution to speed up typing huge chars' sequence. So, keep with you and avoid sharing with others.**

## Requirements
- Arduino Uno (but if you have an Arduino Leonardo, Arduino Micro Pro or any other Arduino that uses ATmega32U4, this code doesn't fits to you).
- Update your Arduino Uno's firmware to act like a HID (HUman Interface Device).
